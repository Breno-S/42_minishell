# 42_minishell

*This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by brensant and rgomes-d.*

# Description

This project consists of a shell application written in C. The goal of this project is to replicate a subset of the [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell, using only a limited set of functions, alongside our own version of the C Standard Library (libft).

## What is a shell?

A shell is an interactive text-based application that allows users to execute and orquestrate programs and procedures inside an operating system, via commands. There are many shell applications available: sh, bash, fish and zsh are the most popular. Most shell scripts are written in bash for portability reasons, as it is POSIX-compliant and used across different operating systems.

## Key Concepts

- Shell Operation
- Unix Files
	- File Descriptors
	- File Redirection
- Unix Pipes
- Processes
- Conditional Execution
- Variable Expansion
